# mixboard [WIP pending]

## Why?
Motivation for this new visualization is to provide alternative of tensorboard for flexibility in development. This visualization board hugely rely on [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org) for its interface.

Requirement:
* bokeh
* vis.js (for visualizing graph network)

## Pro and Cons
Pros:
* Extensible
* Work nicely with Jupyter Notebook
* Can work with huge data (when combining with [datashadder](https://github.com/bokeh/datashader))

Cons:
* Graph visualization can't be as beutifull as tensorflow
